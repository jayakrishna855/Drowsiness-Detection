# Drowsiness-Detection
A Neural Network model that detects whether a person is drowsy or not by capturing the Image part and sending it to the model.
# What is Drowsiness - Detection ?
 It is a safety technology that detects the drowsiness of the drivers while driving the vechiles and prevents the accidents. The objective of this project is detect the face of the driver(with **Open CV**) and identify whether eyes are closed or not (Through **Neural network model**) and alert the driver through an alarm if driver closes eyes for more than certain threshold seconds.
